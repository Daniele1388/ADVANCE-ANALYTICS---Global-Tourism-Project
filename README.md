# 📊 Advance Analytics – Global Tourism Project

*Advanced SQL analytics using window functions and CTEs to explore global tourism performance, segmentation, and country shares.*

This repository represents the **final step** of the **Global Tourism Statistics** project — following the  
[Data Warehouse (DWH)](https://github.com/Daniele1388/DWH---Global-Tourism-Project) and  
[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/Daniele1388/EDA---Global-Tourism-Project) phases.  

While the DWH provides the **data architecture** and the EDA ensures **data quality and consistency**,  
this **Advance Analytics** layer focuses on extracting **insights and patterns** from the Gold Layer  
through advanced SQL modeling, performance metrics, and segmentation logic.

## 📦 Data Source Dependency

All scripts in this repository depend on the **Gold Layer** of the [Global Tourism Data Warehouse](https://github.com/Daniele1388/DWH---Global-Tourism-Project).  

Ensure that the following **views** are available in your SQL Server environment before execution:  

`fact_domestic_tourism`, `fact_inbound_tourism`, `fact_outbound_tourism`, `fact_tourism_industries`,`fact_sdg` and all related dimension tables (`dim_country`, `dim_indicator`, `dim_unit_of_measure`, `dim_year`).  

This repository also complements the [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/Daniele1388/EDA---Global-Tourism-Project) section, which validates and prepares the Gold Layer for advanced analytics.

## 🧭 Analytical Framework

The analytical model follows a modular, multi-layered approach to evaluate tourism performance and segmentation over time.  

![Advance Analytics](Docs/Advance_Analytics.png)

1. **Change Over Time** → Analyzes year-over-year differences and trends.  
2. **Cumulative Analysis** → Computes running totals and averages using window functions.  
3. **Performance Analysis** → Evaluates countries against historical averages.  
4. **Part-to-Whole Analysis** → Calculates relative contributions to global totals.  
5. **Data Segmentation** → Groups indicators into strategic categories and tiers.  
6. **Reporting & Tier Classification** → Consolidates all metrics into a unified analytical model for visualization and interpretation.

Each module is parameterized and reusable, supporting dynamic execution via `sp_executesql`.

## 🎯 Objectives

The goal of this repository is to:

- Perform **advanced SQL-based analytical modeling** on tourism datasets.  
- Measure **performance, growth, and distribution patterns** over time.  
- Identify **dominant, emerging, and marginal markets** in global tourism.  
- Build a reusable **analytical layer** for future Power BI / Tableau reporting.

## 🧩 Analytical Modules

All scripts are written in **T-SQL**, fully documented, and organized by analytical type.

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ⏱️ **Change Over Time** | Calculates year-over-year change and percentage growth using `LAG()` and arithmetic comparisons. |
| 📈 **Cumulative Analysis** | Uses window functions (`SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`) to track running totals and averages. |
| ⚙️ **Performance Analysis** | Compares actual values vs. long-term averages to flag “Above/Below Average” years. |
| 🧮 **Part-to-Whole Analysis** | Calculates each country’s percentage contribution to total global tourism values. |
| 🧠 **Data Segmentation** | Groups indicators into macro-segments (Volume, Capacity, Economic, Transport, Source Markets) and computes their global share. |
| 🧾 **Reporting & Tier Classification** | Creates a unified tourism view (`vw_fact_tourism_all`) and a reusable function `fn_segment_tier()` to calculate country shares, assign segment tiers (5% / 1% / 0.2%), and enable consolidated reporting across all fact tables. |

## 🧠 Insights & Methodology

Each analytical query follows a **structured, reusable workflow**:

- 🧱 **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** to create logical computation stages.  
- 📊 **Window functions** for ranking, cumulative sums, and moving averages.  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic SQL** for flexible parameterization (`@Country`, `@Indicator`, `@Units`).  
- 🔍 **Comparative metrics** for share, growth, and performance classification.  

Together, these techniques ensure both **transparency and analytical power**, forming a bridge between SQL-based computation and BI visualization.

## 📚 Example Insights

- Italy and Spain rank among **Top 5 Global Markets** by total arrivals.  
- The **Cumulative Analysis** confirms a steady growth trend from 1995–2019 before the 2020 drop.  
- **Performance Analysis** identifies “High” and “Low” performance years vs. average historical trends.  
- The **Part-to-Whole module** highlights each country’s relative weight within global inbound and outbound tourism.  
- The **Segmentation Analysis** aggregates indicators into strategic macro-areas (Demand, Capacity, Economic Impact, etc.) and ranks their shares globally.  
- The **Reporting module** consolidates all facts and segments into a unified reporting structure with tier classification.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)** — Main analytical engine.  
- **Draw.io** — Diagram design (`Advance_Analytics.png`).  
- **GitHub** — Version control and documentation.  
- *(Optional)* Power BI for visualization.
